# Formal Complaint and Notice of Intent to File a Claim Regarding Breach of Lease and Unsafe Living Conditions
## Summary of Major Issues
- Air conditioning: The AC was not properly set up before we moved in on the 15th. It should have been functional and able to provide heating, but it was not working properly.
  
- Hot water: There was no hot water available for showers, although it should have been ready.
    
- Washing machine: The washing machine was not functional upon our arrival — there was no water, so we could not do laundry. The following video shows the washing machine being turned on, but there is no water inside. The machine is completely unusable for doing laundry. It serves as proof that the washing machine was not functional upon our arrival, which is part of the landlord’s failure to provide a properly habitable property.

- Refrigerator: The fridge was not adjusted and not cooling when we arrived, which caused all our food to spoil. This resulted in the loss of food and health products worth over a thousand dollars. The following videos show that the refrigerator was already broken before October 15, causing all the food inside to spoil and emit a strong, foul odor. The smell was so bad that the cleaning staff felt nauseous.

- Smoke alarm: The smoke alarm is broken and goes off frequently for no reason. It has been sounding intermittently for about two hours every morning for the past four or five days, seriously disturbing our sleep. We have video evidence of this issue.
When the alarm first went off, we called the landlord but got no response and then we called the tenant office, but they told us to contact a lawyer and sue the landlord, because this unit is not legally allowed to be rented out. They said they were not responsible and did not understand why we were able to move in, since parts of this building are not permitted for rental use — meaning the landlord illegally rented the property to us.
On the next day, when the smoke alarm went off again for no reason, we contacted the tenant office once more, asking them to fix the issue. However, they told us, “If you have a problem, you should call 911.” They refused to take any responsibility or provide any help.

- Garbage: No garbage bin was provided, and we were not informed where or how to dispose of trash. We had already been living there for four to five days before the landlord finally explained the garbage disposal procedure.

- Parking: We were not informed where the parking space is. The lease states that a parking space is included, but it was not ready. We were told to use visitor parking, but we don’t know where that is.
  
- Cleanliness: The property was not properly cleaned. When we moved in, our socks turned black just from walking inside.

- Keys: The lease states we should receive three keys, but we only received one. We now have to get additional keys made ourselves.

- Illegal rental: The management office explicitly stated that the landlord is not allowed to rent out this property, yet it was still rented to us.

- Curtains and shower curtain: The lease stated that the curtains and shower curtain would be installed before the 15th, but they were not. As of now, neither the curtains nor the shower curtain have been installed.

- Package/parcel delivery: We were not informed how to receive packages, what address to use, or how to pick them up. This is the landlord’s responsibility to explain to tenants in advance.

- Floor damage: One section of the floor is damaged — when we step on it, it makes a loud creaking noise, which is very concerning and could indicate a structural problem.

## Personal and Health Impact
### Tenant 1

"The unsafe living conditions, particularly the continuous malfunction of the smoke alarm, have had a severe and escalating impact on my physical and mental health.

For the past several days, the smoke alarm has been going off almost every morning between 8:00 and 10:00 AM, lasting intermittently for one to two hours. This problem has persisted for nearly a week. I have a pre-existing medical condition, myocarditis (heart inflammation), and I already struggle with sleep irregularities due to academic stress.

During the first two days, I tried to tolerate the situation. However, from the third day onward, I began to experience anticipatory anxiety — knowing that the alarm would go off again around the same time caused extreme tension throughout the night. I became unable to fall asleep, constantly waiting for the noise to start. This mental strain triggered palpitations, nervous weakness, and insomnia, worsening my physical condition.

As a result, I have not had a full night of proper sleep for almost a week. My heart condition has been aggravated, my mind often feels unclear and disoriented, and I have experienced significant hair loss due to prolonged stress. I have been using Minoxidil (Rogaine) to restore my hair before, but the recent situation has caused a severe setback, undoing months of progress.

This ongoing situation has made it impossible for me to rest, focus, or study effectively. Consequently, I was unable to perform well in my academic assessments and failed one of my courses during this period.

The persistent noise, psychological distress, and health deterioration are direct results of the landlord’s negligence and the uninhabitable condition of the property. This is no longer a matter of minor inconvenience but a serious violation of my right to live in a safe, peaceful, and healthy environment."
