## Detailed Description of Issues
- Air conditioning: The AC was not properly set up before we moved in. It should have been functional and able to provide heating, but it was not working properly. There are three tenants living in this unit. One of the female tenants was on her menstrual period and suffering from severe menstrual pain. The heating system was not working, and the unit was freezing cold. In addition, there was no hot water available for showering. Another female tenant had a bleeding wound near her lower body and was unable to walk properly, yet she still had to take on tasks that should have been handled by the landlord or the landlord’s agent. The third tenant is a male, but he works full-time in an office from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day, so he is not at home during the day. As a result, only the two female tenants were left to deal with the issues that the landlord failed to address.
  
- Hot water: On the date we moved in, there was no hot water available for showers, although it should have been ready. 
    
- Washing machine: The washing machine was not functional upon our arrival — there was no water, so we could not do laundry. The following video shows the washing machine being turned on, but there is no water inside. The machine is completely unusable for doing laundry. It serves as proof that the washing machine was not functional upon our arrival, which is part of the landlord’s failure to provide a properly habitable property.
  > [YouTube 1](https://youtu.be/DW_nqCBtrLU?si=M6EE8u_NpxhiqbsZ), [YouTube 2](https://youtube.com/shorts/UWzYMTqjg74?si=Rq1gd6kpJbCqIVlo) — *Oct 17, 2025: The washing machine was not functional upon our arrival*
  
- Refrigerator: The fridge was not adjusted and not cooling when we arrived, which caused all our food to spoil. This resulted in the loss of food and health products worth over a thousand dollars. The following videos show that the refrigerator was already broken before our arrival, causing all the food inside to spoil and emit a strong, foul odor. The smell was so bad that the cleaning staff felt nauseous.
The refrigerator in the unit was broken, so we were unable to store any food. As a result, every meal had to be ordered from takeout. However, since the property was not fully prepared, the front entrance was locked due to ongoing construction, and the back entrance was extremely difficult to locate. Every time we ordered food, I had to go all the way down from the fourth floor and walk a long distance to meet the delivery person, which caused significant physical strain. Every step I took was painful and caused bleeding, and my pajamas were covered in blood. At times, the pain was so severe that I wanted to see a doctor. However, because the landlord left so many unresolved issues in the unit, and with multiple technicians coming to the property every day, I had no choice but to stay home to let them in. For example:
	1.	Curtain installation: I had to call, take photos myself and send them to the agent, schedule the measurement, and then coordinate the installation.
	2.	Cleaning: I had to arrange the cleaning schedule, let the cleaners in, and inspect the cleaning from the first to the fourth floor.
	3.	Refrigerator repair: I had to coordinate the technician’s visit, but initially the refrigerator was not repaired. Then we had to wait for the landlord to arrange a new refrigerator to be installed.

  Due to the landlord’s lack of timely responses, the issues piled up. The landlord’s agent would occasionally respond to one or two matters, but the refrigerator issue was urgent. The rotting food inside was emitting a foul and eye-watering smell that was unbearable.
We even tried to hire a refrigerator technician ourselves to get it repaired first. Only then did the landlord’s technician contact us to inspect the refrigerator. We had to carefully coordinate the schedule to ensure that the refrigerator was cleaned by the cleaning staff before the technician arrived.
The landlord’s agent repeatedly tried to shift responsibility onto us, claiming that all matters were being actively addressed and that we had refused the technician’s visit on October 20 at 6 p.m. In reality, we did not refuse; the refrigerator was full of rotten food and blood, and it was impossible for the technician to inspect it without proper cleaning. The cleaning staff could only come on October 21 at 9 a.m. Initially, the agent continued to blame us, but later the technician was rescheduled for October 21, at which point the agent stopped shifting responsibility onto us.

  The landlord’s agent stated that he and the landlord would come to assist us at the management office to resolve these issues. However, the next day they decided not to come and instead only wanted to have a phone call with us. In any case, they never came on-site to help us resolve the problems. I now demand that the landlord reimburse us for:
	1.	The cost of spoiled food; and
	2.	The takeout expenses incurred during the days without a working refrigerator.
  I will attach screenshots of the takeout orders and the estimated value of the spoiled food below. The link below also shows my lower-body wound and the blood-stained pajamas I was wearing.

  > [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/JoMypI0QVAY?si=NRyrTNtG8F-s4wJM) — *This is our own food that we put in the fridge, and it all went bad.*

  When we first moved in, the refrigerator was already broken. On the 23rd, the landlord sent us a temporary fridge. However, the old broken one has been left in our living room ever since. We have asked the landlord several times to remove it, but he hasn’t responded.

  Our living room is already quite small, and now there are two fridges taking up the limited space. These two fridges have been sitting in our living room for three weeks, and we still haven’t received any reply about when they will be removed.
- Smoke alarm: The smoke alarm is broken and goes off frequently for no reason. It has been sounding intermittently for about two hours every morning for the past four or five days, seriously disturbing our sleep. We have video evidence of this issue.
When the alarm first went off, we called the landlord but got no response and then we called the tenant office, but they told us to contact a lawyer and sue the landlord, because this unit is not legally allowed to be rented out. They said they were not responsible and did not understand why we were able to move in, since parts of this building are not permitted for rental use — meaning the landlord illegally rented the property to us.
On the next day, when the smoke alarm went off again for no reason, we contacted the tenant office once more, asking them to fix the issue. However, they told us, “If you have a problem, you should call 911.” They refused to take any responsibility or provide any help.

- Garbage: No garbage bin was provided, and we were not informed where or how to dispose of trash. We had already been living there for four to five days before the landlord finally explained the garbage disposal procedure.

- Parking: We were not informed where the parking space is. The lease states that a parking space is included, but it was not ready. We were told to use visitor parking, but we don’t know where that is. After several follow-ups from my agent, the landlord’s agent eventually mentioned that we could park in a temporary parking lot, but he never provided the exact location. We were unable to locate the temporary parking area, and neither the landlord nor the landlord’s agent came to show us where to park. They themselves did not know the exact location and only showed me a screenshot of the email sent by the management office.
Furthermore, on the day of move-in, neither the landlord nor the landlord’s agent came to meet us or give us a walkthrough of the property. Instead, they simply left the keys in a location for us to pick up on our own.
  
- Cleanliness: The property was not properly cleaned. When we moved in, our socks turned black just from walking inside. The landlord’s agent told us that the property had been thoroughly cleaned before we moved in. However, when we entered, the floors were covered with dust. The landlord’s agent explained that the dust was due to the ongoing construction outside, which they said was normal. I can understand there being some dust, but I don’t believe there would be this much dust inside with all the windows closed if the place had truly been cleaned recently. Regarding the cleaning issue, we reported this problem to the landlord’s agent on October 15, the day we moved in. However, the cleaning staff did not arrive until October 21.

- Keys: The lease states we should receive three keys, but we only received one. We now have to get additional keys made ourselves. In the lease agreement, the landlord promised to provide us with three keys, but we only received one. I reported this issue to the landlord’s agent multiple times, but I never received any response. Because I had a severe skin infection near my lower body, which was still bleeding and made it extremely painful to walk, I was physically unable to go out on my own. Despite this, I had no choice but to take a taxi and personally go to make the additional keys. Below is the cost for making the three keys, which should be reimbursed by the landlord.

- Illegal rental: The management office explicitly stated that the landlord is not allowed to rent out this property, yet it was still rented to us.

- Curtains and shower curtain: The lease stated that the curtains and shower curtain would be installed before the 15th, but they were not. As of now, neither the curtains nor the shower curtain have been installed. Before the lease started on October 15, I asked my agent to reconfirm with the landlord whether the curtains and shower curtains had been installed. The landlord’s agent replied that both had already been installed. However, when we actually moved in, we found that neither the curtains nor the shower curtains were in place. This constitutes a breach of the lease by the landlord. As a result, I had to go to Walmart to purchase a shower curtain myself.
Attached below is the receipt for the shower curtain, and the cost should be reimbursed by the landlord.

- Package/parcel delivery: We were not informed how to receive packages, what address to use, or how to pick them up. This is the landlord’s responsibility to explain to tenants in advance.

- Floor damage: One section of the floor is damaged — when we step on it, it makes a loud creaking noise, which is very concerning and could indicate a structural problem.

- Sensor light: On October 31, 2025, I reported that the sensor light in the fourth-floor bedroom wardrobe has been constantly on. I sent messages to both the landlord and the agent. The landlord replied only once, telling me not to message him again. The agent said they would help me fix the issue, but they have been delaying it and have not taken any action. I sent several follow-up messages, but they only replied to one of them.
The bedroom light has been on all the time, which not only wastes electricity but also seriously affects my sleep. I’ve been struggling with severe insomnia for a long time — I often can’t fall asleep until 5 or 6 a.m. Because of this light, I have to cover it with paper just to block the brightness. It’s having a serious impact on my health and weakening my immune system.
We’ve been very good tenants and never bother the landlord unnecessarily. We always try to solve small issues on our own. However, the landlord’s attitude has been extremely poor. He refuses to take responsibility and even lied to us — first saying he was abroad and couldn’t respond, then saying he would come to fix the issue, but later claiming he couldn’t come and could only use Zoom instead. In fact, the only direct message we ever received from the landlord was the one telling us not to contact him; all other communication has been relayed through his agent.

## Personal and Health Impact
### Tenant 1

"The unsafe living conditions, particularly the continuous malfunction of the smoke alarm, have had a severe and escalating impact on my physical and mental health.

For the past several days, the smoke alarm has been going off almost every morning between 9:00 and 11:00 AM, lasting intermittently for one to two hours. This problem has persisted for nearly a week. I have a pre-existing medical condition, myocarditis (heart inflammation), and I already struggle with sleep irregularities due to academic stress.

During the first two days, I tried to tolerate the situation. However, from the third day onward, I began to experience anticipatory anxiety — knowing that the alarm would go off again around the same time caused extreme tension throughout the night. I became unable to fall asleep, constantly waiting for the noise to start. This mental strain triggered palpitations, nervous weakness, and insomnia, worsening my physical condition.

As a result, I have not had a full night of proper sleep for several days. My heart condition has been aggravated, my mind often feels unclear and disoriented, and I have experienced significant hair loss due to prolonged stress. I have been using Minoxidil (Rogaine) to restore my hair before, but the recent situation has caused a severe setback, undoing months of progress.

In addition, I want to emphasize that these poor living conditions have also had a serious impact on my physical health as a woman.

On the first evening after I moved in, it happened to be the first day of my menstrual period. I always experience severe menstrual cramps on the first day, accompanied by heavy bleeding. However, because there was no hot water in the unit at that evening, I could only use cold water to wash. As a result, my body temperature dropped, and I became sick the following day — I was in so much pain that I could not get out of bed for the entire day.

Moreover, I have acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and must eat clean, freshly prepared food. Normally, I cook for myself to manage my diet. But since the refrigerator was broken and could not keep food fresh, I was unable to buy or store meat, eggs, or vegetables. For the past several days, I have been forced to rely on takeout meals, which are oily and unhealthy. Because of this, my stomach condition has worsened again, and I am now experiencing frequent discomfort and indigestion.

This ongoing situation has made it impossible for me to rest, focus, or study effectively. Consequently, I was unable to perform well in my academic assessments and failed one of my courses during this period.

The persistent noise, psychological distress, and health deterioration are direct results of the landlord’s negligence and the uninhabitable condition of the property. This is no longer a matter of minor inconvenience but a serious violation of my right to live in a safe, peaceful, and healthy environment."

### Tenant 2
"I was already in poor health, and my friend was on her menstrual period, suffering from severe menstrual pain during her midterm exams. Despite this, I had to endure my own physical discomfort to handle matters that should have been completed by the landlord before our move-in. The landlord and their agent even claimed that they had inspected the unit before our arrival—yet the refrigerator was broken. How could they have failed to notice it?

When the landlord arranged for someone to install the curtains, I had to coordinate the schedule with the technician. First, the technician required us to take photos of the windows. I had to walk from the basement to the fourth floor to take and send these photos. Then, the installer scheduled a time to come and measure, and finally another appointment was needed for the actual installation. While these tasks may seem simple, they were extremely difficult for me physically. Each time I had to open doors, I had to walk from the fourth floor down to the entrance and stand nearby to communicate with them. Every trip caused bleeding down my legs, leaving bloodstains on the stairs and floors.

I wanted to see a doctor, but the number of unresolved issues left by the landlord forced me to address these matters first. Even so, the landlord did not reply to our messages. The landlord’s agent only responded to one or two issues and suggested I make phone calls to arrange solutions myself. We made numerous calls, many of which were ineffective. The management office refused to help us because the building was not yet ready for occupancy. Since the landlord chose to rent out the unit, all responsibility should lie with them, and the management office was unwilling to assist.

The problems were urgent and numerous: no hot water, the heating system not working, the washing machine unable to dispense water, the refrigerator not cooling, missing keys, curtains, and shower curtains. Despite repeatedly messaging the landlord with no response, the agent only provided a phone number and told us to contact the technician ourselves. The technician responsible for adjusting the hot water could not come immediately, and a video call failed to resolve the issue.

As a result, we were forced to live for several days without heating, hot water, or a functioning washing machine. Many problems had to be solved entirely on our own."

## Property Loss
My food loss amounts to approximately CAD 1043, which includes fish maw that I had soaked for three days (fish maw is a precious ingredient similar to bird’s nest, valued at CAD 300). The photos show my recent supermarket shopping records at Costco and TNT. Combined: 65.8+117.35+158.65+290+ 42.34+69.28+300 =1043 CAD

The following transaction records show the expenses incurred by the three of us from October 17, 2025 to October 23, 2025, during the period when the refrigerator in the house was broken. Because we were unable to cook at home, we had no choice but to order takeout or eat out.
The total amount spent on takeout and dining out during this period is approximately $1,051 CAD.
These expenses were directly caused by the refrigerator issue and should therefore be reimbursed by the landlord.
