# Formal Complaint and Notice of Intent to File a Claim Regarding Breach of Lease and Unsafe Living Conditions
## Summary of Major Issues
- Air conditioning: The AC was not properly set up before we moved in on the 15th. It should have been functional and able to provide heating, but it was not working properly.
  
- Hot water: There was no hot water available for showers, although it should have been ready.
    
- Washing machine: The washing machine was not functional upon our arrival — there was no water, so we could not do laundry.
  
- Refrigerator: The fridge was not adjusted and not cooling when we arrived, which caused all our food to spoil. This resulted in the loss of food and health products worth over a thousand dollars.

- Smoke alarm: The smoke alarm is broken and goes off frequently for no reason. It has been sounding intermittently for about two hours every morning for the past four or five days, seriously disturbing our sleep. We have video evidence of this issue.
When the alarm first went off, we called the tenant office, but they told us to contact a lawyer and sue the landlord, because this unit is not legally allowed to be rented out. They said they were not responsible and did not understand why we were able to move in, since parts of this building are not permitted for rental use — meaning the landlord illegally rented the property to us.
On the next day, when the smoke alarm went off again for no reason, we contacted the tenant office once more, asking them to fix the issue. However, they told us, “If you have a problem, you should call 911.” They refused to take any responsibility or provide any help.

- Garbage: No garbage bin was provided, and we were not informed where or how to dispose of trash. We had already been living there for four to five days before the landlord finally explained the garbage disposal procedure.

- Parking: We were not informed where the parking space is. The lease states that a parking space is included, but it was not ready. We were told to use visitor parking, but we don’t know where that is.
  
- Cleanliness: The property was not properly cleaned. When we moved in, our socks turned black just from walking inside.

- Keys: The lease states we should receive three keys, but we only received one. We now have to get additional keys made ourselves.

- Illegal rental: The management office explicitly stated that the landlord is not allowed to rent out this property, yet it was still rented to us.

- Curtains and shower curtain: The lease stated that the curtains and shower curtain would be installed before the 15th, but they were not. As of now, neither the curtains nor the shower curtain have been installed.

- Package/parcel delivery: We were not informed how to receive packages, what address to use, or how to pick them up. This is the landlord’s responsibility to explain to tenants in advance.

- Floor damage: One section of the floor is damaged — when we step on it, it makes a loud creaking noise, which is very concerning and could indicate a structural problem.
